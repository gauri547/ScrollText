<b><i>As we drove up to the fort of Bhangarh in Alwar district of Rajasthan, from the Sariska Tiger Reserve, we passed by the Ajabgarh fort</i></b> -Since entry into Bhangarh is restricted after sunset, we were in a hurry. I didn’t climb up the Ajabgarh fort, but I explored its base. A local lad grazing sheep told me that there was nothing that I would be able to see from below except the four walls. If I had known its significance in the destiny of the fort I was going to, I would have made more of an effort.
